This project implements a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
The model is trained on normalized MNIST data and achieves high accuracy in recognizing digits. 
Additionally, the project includes functionality to preprocess and predict digits from custom uploaded images. 
The uploaded images are resized, grayscaled, inverted, and normalized to ensure compatibility with the MNIST-trained model. 
The project outputs both the predicted digit and a visualization of the uploaded image.
